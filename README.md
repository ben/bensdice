# Ben's Dice

This Foundry module is a collection of custom dice sets for use with [Dice So Nice](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/).

## Using this package

Plug `https://github.com/ben/bensdice/blob/main/module.json` into the module installer in the Foundry setup menu.

## Help me

I'm not super good with Blender, but I have figured out how to export files so that Dice So Nice will use them.
Head over to [this document](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to know how to make this your own.
